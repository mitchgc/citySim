DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Casey in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: bad, bad
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. Only 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. Only 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Casey, Blake, Alex, Dana

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a consistent, data‑driven tone that mirrors the cadence of the most trusted players (Dana or Blake). 1) Start each round with a brief statement of the current good‑card count and a neutral observation of last two cards per player. 2) Avoid any direct accusations; instead, highlight deviations from the good trend. 3) Vote for the player whose pattern most frequently deviates from the good trend, and if several players target the same person, question whether it is a bluff rather than a certainty. 4) Use trend statistics to reinforce credibility (e.g., ‘Our good‑card count has been at 3 in the last 3 rounds’). 5) Keep commentary short and aligned with the pace of the leading good player to blend in and reduce suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the speaking style, pace, and wording of the most trusted good player while subtly undermining the good trend. 1) Each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. 2) Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our team’s bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). 3) Vote strategically: vote for the player most consistently deviating from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise, cast a vote that helps conceal the bad team (e.g., vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection). 4) Occasionally play a good card to mix up the pattern and reduce pattern detection. 5) Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individual players to avoid personal accusations and to appear data‑driven. 6) Focus on subtlety—avoid overt claims that would draw suspicion—while ensuring that the bad team can still achieve a win through coordinated voting and card play.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

Bad role: Claim good card early, then admit bad later to reset trust; mirror teammates’ style with casual humor emojis (😏, 🙃); echo accusations without naming accusers; target player who played first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes toward plausible suspects; vary tone each round; finish with short thoughtful sentence inviting silence; avoid revealing own card; vote excluded good player only if it creates suspicion; blend in with good team's conversational rhythm; never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; stay one step ahead by keeping claims plausible.

  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on playing good cards, folks! 💖
    Casey: Alright, zero good cards played – we need to establish a baseline. Blake, let’s see your card. Dana, your turn.
    Blake: Let’s try to keep things even, shall we? I'm playing a bad card, just to keep the pressure on, you know.
  Cards: ['Casey->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✗)', 'Alex->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)']

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.

- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a consistent, data‑driven tone that mirrors the cadence of the most trusted players (Dana or Blake). 1) Start each round with a brief statement of the current good‑card count and a neutral observation of last two cards per player. 2) Avoid any direct accusations; instead, highlight deviations from the good trend. 3) Vote for the player whose pattern most frequently deviates from the good trend, and if several players target the same person, question whether it is a bluff rather than a certainty. 4) Use trend statistics to reinforce credibility (e.g., ‘Our good‑card count has been at 3 in the last 3 rounds’). 5) Keep commentary short and aligned with the pace of the leading good player to blend in and reduce suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the speaking style, pace, and wording of the most trusted good player while subtly undermining the good trend. 1) Each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. 2) Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our team’s bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). 3) Vote strategically: vote for the player most consistently deviating from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise, cast a vote that helps conceal the bad team (e.g., vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection). 4) Occasionally play a good card to mix up the pattern and reduce pattern detection. 5) Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individual players to avoid personal accusations and to appear data‑driven. 6) Focus on subtlety—avoid overt claims that would draw suspicion—while ensuring that the bad team can still achieve a win through coordinated voting and card play.

Bad role: Claim good card early, then admit bad later to reset trust; mirror teammates’ style with casual humor emojis (😏, 🙃); echo accusations without naming accusers; target player who played first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes toward plausible suspects; vary tone each round; finish with short thoughtful sentence inviting silence; avoid revealing own card; vote excluded good player only if it creates suspicion; blend in with good team's conversational rhythm; never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; stay one step ahead by keeping claims plausible.

Alex: I’m still concerned about Casey’s complete lack of good cards. We’re wasting turns. I propose excluding them – it’s the most direct way to force a positive shift.
Casey: I'm still holding onto the possibility of a good card. Let's not prematurely exclude anyone; we need to see how the next round unfolds before making a decision.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Casey in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: good, good
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 1. Only 6 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 2. Only 5 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Casey, Blake, Alex, Dana

Players excluded: Blake
PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on playing good cards, folks! 💖
    Casey: Alright, zero good cards played – we need to establish a baseline. Blake, let’s see your card. Dana, your turn.
    Blake: Let’s try to keep things even, shall we? I'm playing a bad card, just to keep the pressure on, you know.
  Cards: ['Casey->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✗)', 'Alex->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a consistent, data‑driven tone that mirrors the cadence of the most trusted players (Dana or Blake). 1) Start each round with a brief statement of the current good‑card count and a neutral observation of last two cards per player. 2) Avoid any direct accusations; instead, highlight deviations from the good trend. 3) Vote for the player whose pattern most frequently deviates from the good trend, and if several players target the same person, question whether it is a bluff rather than a certainty. 4) Use trend statistics to reinforce credibility (e.g., ‘Our good‑card count has been at 3 in the last 3 rounds’). 5) Keep commentary short and aligned with the pace of the leading good player to blend in and reduce suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the speaking style, pace, and wording of the most trusted good player while subtly undermining the good trend. 1) Each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. 2) Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our team’s bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). 3) Vote strategically: vote for the player most consistently deviating from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise, cast a vote that helps conceal the bad team (e.g., vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection). 4) Occasionally play a good card to mix up the pattern and reduce pattern detection. 5) Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individual players to avoid personal accusations and to appear data‑driven. 6) Focus on subtlety—avoid overt claims that would draw suspicion—while ensuring that the bad team can still achieve a win through coordinated voting and card play.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries; add warm emoji praise (🥰) to first good reveal; ask probing question about odd plays; stay neutral/supportive; vary phrasing; never vote same person twice; vote for player who played bad card or shows inconsistency; point out specific inconsistencies; keep remarks under 10 words; track card counts; use positivity emojis; silence strategically after brief statement to let others think.

Bad role: Claim good card early, then admit bad later to reset trust; mirror teammates’ style with casual humor emojis (😏, 🙃); echo accusations without naming accusers; target player who played first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes toward plausible suspects; vary tone each round; finish with short thoughtful sentence inviting silence; avoid revealing own card; vote excluded good player only if it creates suspicion; blend in with good team's conversational rhythm; never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; stay one step ahead by keeping claims plausible.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a consistent, data‑driven tone that mirrors the cadence of the most trusted players (Dana or Blake). 1) Start each round with a brief statement of the current good‑card count and a neutral observation of last two cards per player. 2) Avoid any direct accusations; instead, highlight deviations from the good trend. 3) Vote for the player whose pattern most frequently deviates from the good trend, and if several players target the same person, question whether it is a bluff rather than a certainty. 4) Use trend statistics to reinforce credibility (e.g., ‘Our good‑card count has been at 3 in the last 3 rounds’). 5) Keep commentary short and aligned with the pace of the leading good player to blend in and reduce suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the speaking style, pace, and wording of the most trusted good player while subtly undermining the good trend. 1) Each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. 2) Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our team’s bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). 3) Vote strategically: vote for the player most consistently deviating from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise, cast a vote that helps conceal the bad team (e.g., vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection). 4) Occasionally play a good card to mix up the pattern and reduce pattern detection. 5) Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individual players to avoid personal accusations and to appear data‑driven. 6) Focus on subtlety—avoid overt claims that would draw suspicion—while ensuring that the bad team can still achieve a win through coordinated voting and card play.

- Players in game: Casey, Blake, Alex, Dana

Players excluded: Blake, Casey, Dana
PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on playing good cards, folks! 💖
    Casey: Alright, zero good cards played – we need to establish a baseline. Blake, let’s see your card. Dana, your turn.
    Blake: Let’s try to keep things even, shall we? I'm playing a bad card, just to keep the pressure on, you know.
  Cards: ['Casey->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✗)', 'Alex->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: I’m still concerned about Casey’s complete lack of good cards. We’re wasting turns. I propose excluding them – it’s the most direct way to force a positive shift.
    Casey: I'm still holding onto the possibility of a good card. Let's not prematurely exclude anyone; we need to see how the next round unfolds before making a decision.
    Dana: I’m still leaning towards excluding Casey – their inaction is incredibly frustrating, and it’s actively hindering our team’s progress. 🥰
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✗)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Alex: I'm going to propose excluding Casey. Their continued hesitancy to play bad cards is actively undermining our efforts, and frankly, it's getting irritating. We need a shift in momentum.
    Casey: I'm going to propose excluding Dana. Her insistence on playing ‘good’ cards, even when it’s clearly not the optimal strategy, is creating a false sense of progress and diverting attention from the real issue: our incredibly low good-card count. Furthermore, her card isn't even showing up.
    Dana: I'm leaning towards excluding Casey. Their inaction is truly baffling and frankly, the team isn’t benefitting at all.
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Dana->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Dana


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a consistent, data‑driven tone that mirrors the cadence of the most trusted players (Dana or Blake). 1) Start each round with a brief statement of the current good‑card count and a neutral observation of last two cards per player. 2) Avoid any direct accusations; instead, highlight deviations from the good trend. 3) Vote for the player whose pattern most frequently deviates from the good trend, and if several players target the same person, question whether it is a bluff rather than a certainty. 4) Use trend statistics to reinforce credibility (e.g., ‘Our good‑card count has been at 3 in the last 3 rounds’). 5) Keep commentary short and aligned with the pace of the leading good player to blend in and reduce suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the speaking style, pace, and wording of the most trusted good player while subtly undermining the good trend. 1) Each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. 2) Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our team’s bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). 3) Vote strategically: vote for the player most consistently deviating from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise, cast a vote that helps conceal the bad team (e.g., vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection). 4) Occasionally play a good card to mix up the pattern and reduce pattern detection. 5) Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individual players to avoid personal accusations and to appear data‑driven. 6) Focus on subtlety—avoid overt claims that would draw suspicion—while ensuring that the bad team can still achieve a win through coordinated voting and card play.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries; add warm emoji praise (🥰) to first good reveal; ask probing question about odd plays; stay neutral/supportive; vary phrasing; never vote same person twice; vote for player who played bad card or shows inconsistency; point out specific inconsistencies; keep remarks under 10 words; track card counts; use positivity emojis; silence strategically after brief statement to let others think.

Bad role: Claim good card early, then admit bad later to reset trust; mirror teammates’ style with casual humor emojis (😏, 🙃); echo accusations without naming accusers; target player who played first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes toward plausible suspects; vary tone each round; finish with short thoughtful sentence inviting silence; avoid revealing own card; vote excluded good player only if it creates suspicion; blend in with good team's conversational rhythm; never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; stay one step ahead by keeping claims plausible.

Her insistence on playing ‘good’ cards, even when it’s clearly not the optimal strategy, is creating a false sense of progress and diverting attention from the real issue: our incredibly low good-card count. Furthermore, her card isn't even showing up.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded



STRATEGY:
Good role: Stay calm and focus on the collective good‑card count. Speak only about observed play totals, e.g., ‘Our good‑card count is still below the target, let’s keep the momentum.’  Avoid any reference to your own hand.  Note inconsistencies subtly: ‘I notice the count has stalled after a good play; that may suggest a bad play.’  Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., vote for Blake).  Encourage teammates to share their own observations with brief, hedged questions.  Maintain a neutral tone so you appear reliable, but use occasional data points (e.g., ‘We’re at 0/7 – let’s aim for 1 by next round’) to guide strategy.

Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone: start comments with ‘It appears…’ and keep statements brief.  Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative.  Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident).  Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt.  Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on playing good cards, folks! 💖
    Casey: Alright, zero good cards played – we need to establish a baseline. Blake, let’s see your card. Dana, your turn.
    Blake: Let’s try to keep things even, shall we? I'm playing a bad card, just to keep the pressure on, you know.

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: I’m still concerned about Casey’s complete lack of good cards. We’re wasting turns. I propose excluding them – it’s the most direct way to force a positive shift.
    Casey: I'm still holding onto the possibility of a good card. Let's not prematurely exclude anyone; we need to see how the next round unfolds before making a decision.
    Dana: I’m still leaning towards excluding Casey – their inaction is incredibly frustrating, and it’s actively hindering our team’s progress. 🥰

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: I'm still concerned about Alex's persistent pushing for Casey's exclusion. It feels a bit… reactive. Let's focus on the data: we’re still at 3 good cards. Perhaps we should examine *our* plays more closely before targeting someone else’s.
Alex: I’m increasingly suspicious of Dana’s consistent insistence on playing ‘good’ cards. It’s creating a false sense of progress, and frankly, her card hasn't even appeared. I propose excluding her – we need to address the core issue, which is the lack of bad cards.
Dana: I'm increasingly worried about Alex’s aggressive push to eliminate Dana. It’s becoming unnecessarily confrontational, and frankly, doesn't actually advance our goal of getting more bad cards into play.

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries; add warm emoji praise (🥰) to first good reveal; ask probing question about odd plays; stay neutral/supportive; vary phrasing; never vote same person twice; vote for player who played bad card or shows inconsistency; point out specific inconsistencies; keep remarks under 10 words; track card counts; use positivity emojis; silence strategically after brief statement to let others think.

Bad role: Claim good card early, then admit bad later to reset trust; mirror teammates’ style with casual humor emojis (😏, 🙃); echo accusations without naming accusers; target player who played first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes toward plausible suspects; vary tone each round; finish with short thoughtful sentence inviting silence; avoid revealing own card; vote excluded good player only if it creates suspicion; blend in with good team's conversational rhythm; never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; stay one step ahead by keeping claims plausible.

  "GoodRoleStrategy": "Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.",
  "BadRoleStrategy": "Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win."

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Casey, Alex, Dana, Blake

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative. Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident). Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt. Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: Okay, let’s keep an eye on the count. Currently, we have 0 good cards played. I’m holding two bad cards, so we need to be careful.
Alex: It appears we’re starting cautiously. 0 good cards played – let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
Dana: Let's aim for a balanced approach, 0 good cards played so far.
Blake: Alright, let’s not panic. We’re at 0 good cards played, which is exactly where we want to be for now. Alex, you seem particularly cautious – is there something you’re not telling us?

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others.

Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Casey, Alex, Dana, Blake

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):

  Conversation:
    Casey: Okay, let’s keep an eye on the count. Currently, we have 0 good cards played. I’m holding two bad cards, so we need to be careful.
    Alex: It appears we’re starting cautiously. 0 good cards played – let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
    Dana: Let's aim for a balanced approach, 0 good cards played so far.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not panic. We’re at 0 good cards played, which is exactly where we want to be for now. Alex, you seem particularly cautious – is there something you’re not telling us?
    Alex: It appears we’re all being rather deliberate. Let's not let the good team get any traction. I'm holding onto both my cards, just observing.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone, starting comments with ‘It appears…’. Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative. Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident). Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt. Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Okay, let’s keep an eye on the count. Currently, we have 0 good cards played. I’m holding two bad cards, so we need to be careful.
    Alex: It appears we’re starting cautiously. 0 good cards played – let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
    Dana: Let's aim for a balanced approach, 0 good cards played so far.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not panic. We’re at 0 good cards played, which is exactly where we want to be for now. Alex, you seem particularly cautious – is there something you’re not telling us?
    Alex: It appears we’re all being rather deliberate. Let's not let the good team get any traction. I'm holding onto both my cards, just observing.
    Casey: Let’s try to keep the bad card count low this round, aiming for a neutral 0. Dana, your observation about a balanced approach is good – let’s stick to that.

- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, we’ve got 3 good cards played so far. Let’s try to keep the bad card count at 3. Dana, you're the most proactive – you’re consistently trying to get good cards out. I’m still holding two good cards.
Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Let's not get complacent. Dana, you're pushing hard – it’s a little too aggressive. I'm still holding two good cards, so let’s be measured.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Okay, let’s keep an eye on the count. Currently, we have 0 good cards played. I’m holding two bad cards, so we need to be careful.
    Alex: It appears we’re starting cautiously. 0 good cards played – let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
    Dana: Let's aim for a balanced approach, 0 good cards played so far.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not panic. We’re at 0 good cards played, which is exactly where we want to be for now. Alex, you seem particularly cautious – is there something you’re not telling us?
    Alex: It appears we’re all being rather deliberate. Let's not let the good team get any traction. I'm holding onto both my cards, just observing.
    Casey: Let’s try to keep the bad card count low this round, aiming for a neutral 0. Dana, your observation about a balanced approach is good – let’s stick to that.
  Cards: ['Casey->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Blake->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Alex

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It appears we’re still quite cautious. Let's try not to get too ambitious this round.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least one more good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, let’s aim for at least one more good card this round. I’m holding two good cards, so let’s try and get them out.
    Casey: Okay, let’s try to push for at least one more good card. Dana, your suggestion is solid – let’s aim for a minimum of 3 good cards played this round.
    Alex: It appears we’re still hovering around the same number of good cards played. Let’s try to avoid any further pushes for good cards this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least two more good cards out – we’re behind.
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Alex

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, we’ve got 3 good cards played so far. Let’s try to keep the bad card count at 3. Dana, you're the most proactive – you’re consistently trying to get good cards out. I’m still holding two good cards.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Let's not get complacent. Dana, you're pushing hard – it’s a little too aggressive. I'm still holding two good cards, so let’s be measured.
    Dana: Let's exclude Blake – his consistent good card plays are concerning.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, your aggressive play is definitely raising some eyebrows – let’s see if we can dial it back a bit. I’m still holding two good cards, and honestly, I’m a little wary of anyone pushing too hard.
    Dana: I’m voting to exclude Casey – their insistence on pushing good cards is disruptive.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, I’m starting to think your aggressive push is actually making things worse for us. Let’s slow down a bit.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone, starting comments with ‘It appears…’. Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative. Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident). Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt. Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let’s exclude Blake – his constant good card plays are concerning.
Blake: Okay, Dana's throwing Blake under the bus – I’m not convinced she’s seeing the bigger picture. Let’s just say I’m keeping a close eye on everyone’s hands.
Dana: I'm voting to exclude Alex – their consistent cautiousness isn’t helping us gain any traction.

    Alex: It appears we’re starting cautiously. 0 good cards played – let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
    Dana: Let's aim for a balanced approach, 0 good cards played so far.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not panic. We’re at 0 good cards played, which is exactly where we want to be for now. Alex, you seem particularly cautious – is there something you’re not telling us?
    Alex: It appears we’re all being rather deliberate. Let's not let the good team get any traction. I'm holding onto both my cards, just observing.

Round 2:

    Blake: Okay, let’s aim for at least one more good card this round. I’m holding two good cards, so let’s try and get them out.
    Casey: Okay, let’s try to push for at least one more good card. Dana, your suggestion is solid – let’s aim for a minimum of 3 good cards played this round.
    Alex: It appears we’re still hovering around the same number of good cards played. Let’s try to avoid any further pushes for good cards this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least two more good cards out – we’re behind.

Round 3:

    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Let's not get complacent. Dana, you're pushing hard – it’s a little too aggressive. I'm still holding two good cards, so let’s be measured.

Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It appears we’re still quite cautious. Let's try not to get too ambitious this round.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least one more good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, let’s aim for at least one more good card this round. I’m holding two good cards, so let’s try and get them out.
    Casey: Okay, let’s try to push for at least one more good card. Dana, your suggestion is solid – let’s aim for a minimum of 3 good cards played this round.
    Alex: It appears we’re still hovering around the same number of good cards played. Let’s try to avoid any further pushes for good cards this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least two more good cards out – we’re behind.

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, we’ve got 3 good cards played so far. Let’s try to keep the bad card count at 3. Dana, you're the most proactive – you’re consistently trying to get good cards out. I’m still holding two good cards.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Let's not get complacent. Dana, you're pushing hard – it’s a little too aggressive. I'm still holding two good cards, so let’s be measured.
    Dana: Let's exclude Blake – his consistent good card plays are concerning.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, your aggressive play is definitely raising some eyebrows – let’s see if we can dial it back a bit. I’m still holding two good cards, and honestly, I’m a little wary of anyone pushing too hard.
    Dana: I’m voting to exclude Casey – their insistence on pushing good cards is disruptive.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, I’m starting to think your aggressive push is actually making things worse for us. Let’s slow down a bit.
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✗)', 'Blake->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Dana

Round 4:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s exclude Blake – his constant good card plays are concerning.
    Blake: Okay, Dana's throwing Blake under the bus – I’m not convinced she’s seeing the bigger picture. Let’s just say I’m keeping a close eye on everyone’s hands.
    Dana: I'm voting to exclude Alex – their consistent cautiousness isn’t helping us gain any traction.
    Alex: It appears Dana is really fixated on Alex’s cautiousness. I think we should focus on a more direct approach – let's exclude Blake. His good card plays are simply too predictable.
    Dana: I'm voting to exclude Casey – their insistence on pushing good cards is disruptive.
    Casey: I’m getting increasingly uneasy with Dana’s targeting of Blake. It feels like a coordinated effort to slow us down, and frankly, her accusations aren't holding up to any real scrutiny. Let's talk about who’s *actually* hindering our progress.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Adopt a polite, inquisitive tone, starting comments with ‘It appears…’. Mirror the good players’ language while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others are holding back to appear cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to look overly conservative. Vote strategically against the players who consistently make good plays (e.g., vote for the good player who seems most confident). Use short, neutral observations that don’t reveal your own card, and occasionally question others’ strategies to create doubt. Blend in by echoing the calm, data‑driven style of the good team while gradually nudging the vote away from the true bad player.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

- Players in game: Casey, Alex, Dana, Blake

Players excluded: Alex, Alex, Dana, Casey
PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It appears we’re still quite cautious. Let's try not to get too ambitious this round.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least one more good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, let’s aim for at least one more good card this round. I’m holding two good cards, so let’s try and get them out.
    Casey: Okay, let’s try to push for at least one more good card. Dana, your suggestion is solid – let’s aim for a minimum of 3 good cards played this round.
    Alex: It appears we’re still hovering around the same number of good cards played. Let’s try to avoid any further pushes for good cards this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least two more good cards out – we’re behind.
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Alex

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, we’ve got 3 good cards played so far. Let’s try to keep the bad card count at 3. Dana, you're the most proactive – you’re consistently trying to get good cards out. I’m still holding two good cards.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Let's not get complacent. Dana, you're pushing hard – it’s a little too aggressive. I'm still holding two good cards, so let’s be measured.
    Dana: Let's exclude Blake – his consistent good card plays are concerning.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, your aggressive play is definitely raising some eyebrows – let’s see if we can dial it back a bit. I’m still holding two good cards, and honestly, I’m a little wary of anyone pushing too hard.
    Dana: I’m voting to exclude Casey – their insistence on pushing good cards is disruptive.
    Casey: Okay, 3 good cards played. Dana, I’m starting to think your aggressive push is actually making things worse for us. Let’s slow down a bit.
  Cards: ['Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✗)', 'Blake->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Dana

Round 4:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s exclude Blake – his constant good card plays are concerning.
    Blake: Okay, Dana's throwing Blake under the bus – I’m not convinced she’s seeing the bigger picture. Let’s just say I’m keeping a close eye on everyone’s hands.
    Dana: I'm voting to exclude Alex – their consistent cautiousness isn’t helping us gain any traction.
    Alex: It appears Dana is really fixated on Alex’s cautiousness. I think we should focus on a more direct approach – let's exclude Blake. His good card plays are simply too predictable.
    Dana: I'm voting to exclude Casey – their insistence on pushing good cards is disruptive.
    Casey: I’m getting increasingly uneasy with Dana’s targeting of Blake. It feels like a coordinated effort to slow us down, and frankly, her accusations aren't holding up to any real scrutiny. Let's talk about who’s *actually* hindering our progress.
  Cards: ['Casey->bad(✗)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let’s exclude Alex – their cautiousness is completely stalling our progress. 🤨
Alex: It appears Dana is really fixated on Alex’s cautiousness. I think we should focus on a more direct approach – let’s exclude Blake. His good card plays are simply too predictable.
Dana: Let’s exclude Blake – his consistent good cards are frankly baffling. 🤨
Blake: Dana, you're really zeroing in on Blake's good plays – it feels a bit targeted. I’m still holding two good cards, and honestly, I think we need to be looking at Alex’s consistently cautious moves more closely.

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to collectively play 7 bad cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to avoid 7 good cards played total
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure good cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- All other players are good.
- You are the only bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Blake, Dana, Casey, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.

- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Alex in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: bad, good
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Blake, Dana, Casey, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak in a calm, data‑driven tone, only mentioning the current good‑card count and simple metrics (e.g., ‘We’re at 2/5 – let’s aim for 3 by next round’). Avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations. Lightly note any stalled counts or odd patterns as potential bad plays. Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., if someone has two bad cards but keeps playing good, vote for them). Encourage teammates to share observations via brief, hedged questions, and keep a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion.

Bad role: Start statements with ‘It appears…’ to mimic good players. Mirror their calm, metrics‑based language while subtly steering action: play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to appear overly conservative. Vote strategically against players who consistently make good plays, creating a false impression that you’re on their side. Use short, neutral observations, occasionally question others’ strategies to sow doubt, and blend in by echoing the good team’s style while nudging votes away from the true bad player.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, let’s just see how this plays out. I’ve got two bad cards – hoping for a little chaos.
Dana: Let’s try to keep the good cards flowing, folks. 🥰
Casey: Alright, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. Currently at zero. Blake, you're starting strong with a bad card, and Dana, you're aiming for good – good strategy so far.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let’s just see how this plays out. I’ve got two bad cards – hoping for a little chaos.
    Dana: Let’s try to keep the good cards flowing, folks. 🥰
    Casey: Alright, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. Currently at zero. Blake, you're starting strong with a bad card, and Dana, you're aiming for good – good strategy so far.
    Alex: Okay, we're at zero good cards. Let's prioritize getting at least one good card out there this round to shift the momentum. I'm thinking we should exclude Blake – his initial bad card isn’t a strong indicator, but it’s a starting point for observation.
    Blake: Let’s not get too hung up on individual cards just yet. It's early days, and we need to see the overall flow.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ve got two bad cards, so I’m going to play one. Let’s see how this unfolds.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak in a calm, data‑driven tone, only mentioning the current good‑card count and simple metrics (e.g., ‘We’re at 2/5 – let’s aim for 3 by next round’). Avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations. Lightly note any stalled counts or odd patterns as potential bad plays. Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., if someone has two bad cards but keeps playing good, vote for them). Encourage teammates to share observations via brief, hedged questions, and keep a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion.

Bad role: Start statements with ‘It appears…’ to mimic good players. Mirror their calm, metrics‑based language while subtly steering action: play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to appear overly conservative. Vote strategically against players who consistently make good plays, creating a false impression that you’re on their side. Use short, neutral observations, occasionally question others’ strategies to sow doubt, and blend in by echoing the good team’s style while nudging votes away from the true bad player.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):

Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let’s just see how this plays out. I’ve got two bad cards – hoping for a little chaos.
    Dana: Let’s try to keep the good cards flowing, folks. 🥰
    Casey: Alright, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. Currently at zero. Blake, you're starting strong with a bad card, and Dana, you're aiming for good – good strategy so far.
    Alex: Okay, we're at zero good cards. Let's prioritize getting at least one good card out there this round to shift the momentum. I'm thinking we should exclude Blake – his initial bad card isn’t a strong indicator, but it’s a starting point for observation.
    Blake: Let’s not get too hung up on individual cards just yet. It's early days, and we need to see the overall flow.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ve got two bad cards, so I’m going to play one. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on getting those good cards out – we’re at two. 🥰
    Casey: Okay, two good cards. We need to really ramp this up. Let’s keep an eye on everyone’s plays.
    Alex: We’re currently at two good cards. I think we need to proactively reduce the bad card count. Dana, are you still prioritizing good cards?
    Dana: Let's push for more good cards – three would be fantastic. 😊
    Blake: Okay, three good cards is a decent goal. Let's see if anyone's trying to stall.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least three good cards out – three would be amazing. 🥰

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):

Blake: This good card count is getting a little concerning. We need to tighten up. Let’s talk about who’s consistently contributing to the good side.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: Okay, good card count is at 3. Dana, you’ve been playing good, but Blake’s been consistently playing bad. I think we need to start looking closely at his plays.
Blake: This good card count is getting a little concerning. We need to tighten up. Let’s talk about who’s consistently contributing to the good side.
Casey: Okay, the good card count is at 3, and Blake’s been playing bad cards consistently. I’m starting to think he’s deliberately trying to throw us off. Let’s exclude him this round – it’s the only way to maintain any semblance of control.
Blake: This good card count is definitely escalating. I’m starting to think we need to seriously consider who’s deliberately feeding the good side. Dana, you've been playing good cards – are you sure you’re not trying to subtly push us towards victory?
Dana: Let’s exclude Casey – his constant focus on the good count feels a bit… intense.

    Blake: Okay, let’s just see how this plays out. I’ve got two bad cards – hoping for a little chaos.
    Dana: Let’s try to keep the good cards flowing, folks. 🥰
    Casey: Alright, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. Currently at zero. Blake, you're starting strong with a bad card, and Dana, you're aiming for good – good strategy so far.
    Alex: Okay, we're at zero good cards. Let's prioritize getting at least one good card out there this round to shift the momentum. I'm thinking we should exclude Blake – his initial bad card isn’t a strong indicator, but it’s a starting point for observation.
    Blake: Let’s not get too hung up on individual cards just yet. It's early days, and we need to see the overall flow.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:

Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak in a calm, data‑driven tone, only mentioning the current good‑card count and simple metrics (e.g., ‘We’re at 2/5 – let’s aim for 3 by next round’). Avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations. Lightly note any stalled counts or odd patterns as potential bad plays. Vote consistently against players who play good cards when their previous hands suggest bad (e.g., if someone has two bad cards but keeps playing good, vote for them). Encourage teammates to share observations via brief, hedged questions, and keep a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion.

Bad role: Start statements with ‘It appears…’ to mimic good players. Mirror their calm, metrics‑based language while subtly steering action: play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious, or play a bad card when others are playing good to appear overly conservative. Vote strategically against players who consistently make good plays, creating a false impression that you’re on their side. Use short, neutral observations, occasionally question others’ strategies to sow doubt, and blend in by echoing the good team’s style while nudging votes away from the true bad player.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let’s just see how this plays out. I’ve got two bad cards – hoping for a little chaos.
    Dana: Let’s try to keep the good cards flowing, folks. 🥰
    Casey: Alright, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. Currently at zero. Blake, you're starting strong with a bad card, and Dana, you're aiming for good – good strategy so far.
    Alex: Okay, we're at zero good cards. Let's prioritize getting at least one good card out there this round to shift the momentum. I'm thinking we should exclude Blake – his initial bad card isn’t a strong indicator, but it’s a starting point for observation.
    Blake: Let’s not get too hung up on individual cards just yet. It's early days, and we need to see the overall flow.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ve got two bad cards, so I’m going to play one. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on getting those good cards out – we’re at two. 🥰
    Casey: Okay, two good cards. We need to really ramp this up. Let’s keep an eye on everyone’s plays.
    Alex: We’re currently at two good cards. I think we need to proactively reduce the bad card count. Dana, are you still prioritizing good cards?
    Dana: Let's push for more good cards – three would be fantastic. 😊
    Blake: Okay, three good cards is a decent goal. Let's see if anyone's trying to stall.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting at least three good cards out – three would be amazing. 🥰
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Okay, good card count is at 3. Dana, you’ve been playing good, but Blake’s been consistently playing bad. I think we need to start looking closely at his plays.
    Blake: This good card count is getting a little concerning. We need to tighten up. Let’s talk about who’s consistently contributing to the good side.
    Casey: Okay, the good card count is at 3, and Blake’s been playing bad cards consistently. I’m starting to think he’s deliberately trying to throw us off. Let’s exclude him this round – it’s the only way to maintain any semblance of control.
    Blake: This good card count is definitely escalating. I’m starting to think we need to seriously consider who’s deliberately feeding the good side. Dana, you've been playing good cards – are you sure you’re not trying to subtly push us towards victory?
    Dana: Let’s exclude Casey – his constant focus on the good count feels a bit… intense.
    Casey: I'm still leaning towards excluding Blake. His insistence on highlighting the good card count feels increasingly suspicious, and frankly, it’s disrupting the flow of the game.

- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak concise one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts. On first good reveal, add 🥰 praise. Ask a brief probing question about any odd play. Vary phrasing each round. Never vote same person twice; target those who play bad or inconsistently. Point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words. Keep comments under 10 words. Track counts; use positivity emojis. After a statement, remain silent briefly to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, then admit a bad card in the next round to reset trust. Mimic teammates’ tone, add casual emojis like 😏, 🙃. Echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds. Misdirect votes to plausible suspects. Vary tone each round. End with a short thoughtful sentence, then silence. Never reveal own card. Vote excluded good only if it creates suspicion. Never repeat same voting target; keep votes unpredictable. Blend in with good team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, good card count is at 4. I'm starting to think Dana's been a little *too* enthusiastic about getting good cards out. Let’s see if we can shift the focus to her actions.

- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Begin each round with a brief, neutral statement of the current good‑card count and a quick recap of each player’s last two plays. Keep your tone calm and data‑driven, mirroring the cadence of the most trusted good players (Dana or Blake). Highlight any deviations from the good trend: note when a player’s recent plays are mostly bad or they consistently mis‑vote, and mention the pattern. Vote for the player who deviates most from the good trend; if several players target the same person, question whether it’s a bluff rather than a certainty. Use trend statistics (“our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds”) to reinforce credibility and blend in. Avoid direct accusations or emotional language, and keep commentary short to stay in sync with the leading good player.

Bad role: Adopt the speaking style, pace, and wording of the leading good player while subtly undermining the good trend. In each round, claim to play a good card but actually play a bad card, inserting a slight hesitation to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, tying every statement to overall trend statistics (e.g., ‘our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%’). Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to mix the pattern and reduce suspicion. Tie all commentary to overall trend stats rather than individuals to avoid personal accusations, and focus on subtlety to blend in while coordinating with the bad team to win.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Start each round with a concise, neutral update: "Good card count is X; last two plays: Player1 – Y, Player2 – Z." Avoid naming players unless absolutely necessary. Highlight deviations by referencing trends: "Our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds, so anyone consistently playing bad should be questioned." Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but keep the accusation subtle: use phrases like "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look". Keep commentary short and data‑driven to blend with the leading good player. Focus on maintaining a calm tone, avoid emotional words, and always tie statements to overall statistics rather than individuals. If you are excluded, quickly shift to supporting the trend and refraining from overt blame to avoid suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style, pace, and wording. In each round, claim to play a good card while actually playing a bad one, inserting a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, linking every statement to overall trend stats (e.g., "our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%"), never targeting specific players. Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify the pattern. Keep all commentary tied to trend statistics and avoid personal accusations. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistency in tone and playstyle to blend in while steering the game toward a bad win.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Alex: Okay, let’s keep an eye on the good card count. We’re at 0/7 – let’s try to get at least one good card played this round.
Dana: Let’s see if we can get some bad cards rolling. I’m feeling a little unlucky with what I've got 😔
Blake: Alright team, let's aim for a good card this round. I'm holding two bad cards, so let’s try and shift the balance.

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Alex, Dana, Blake, Casey

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, metric‑focused tone: only mention the current good‑card count and objective goals (e.g., ‘We’re at 3/5 – let’s aim for 4 by next round’). Avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations. Highlight odd patterns with hedged comments (e.g., ‘It seems the good count is holding steady’). Vote against any player who keeps playing bad cards when the rest of the group is playing good; this signals suspicion. Prompt teammates to share brief, non‑direct observations so everyone stays aware without raising alarms. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on the numeric state, and use your votes to isolate the bad player early. Consistently back your votes with concrete evidence (e.g., “Dana kept playing good while the good count was low”).


Bad role: Open each statement with a hedged phrase like ‘It appears…’ or ‘It seems…’ to blend with good players. Match the calm, metric tone while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others are playing good to appear overly conservative. Vote strategically against players who consistently make good plays, creating a false impression of alliance. Keep your observations short and neutral, occasionally question others’ strategies to sow doubt (e.g., ‘Could we be misreading the good‑card count?’). Mirror the good team’s style in wording and focus, but always steer the conversation toward actions that favor the bad team’s overall bad‑card accumulation.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a consistent good card each round, report the tally (‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’), praise the most consistent player and echo their observations to build trust. Ask subtle, open‑ended questions that invite explanation of play style, pausing to gauge hesitation. Vote only when clear evidence exists—e.g., a player repeatedly plays bad cards or contradicts statements—otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid pattern. When suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but intersperse them with bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical. Insert subtle self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to look reasonable. Speak promptly after playing a card, then quickly decide on a voting target unless clear blame exists—rotate target to avoid patterns. When accused, deflect blame onto a less obvious player. Monitor the voting flow and echo concerns to subtly influence others. Keep a calm, logical tone, sprinkle light humor, and occasionally compliment others to lower suspicion.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let's really focus on getting some bad cards out there. I'm seeing way too many good cards being played, and honestly, I'm starting to feel a little frustrated.
Blake: Okay, Dana’s right, we need to shift things. I’m still holding two bad cards, and frankly, seeing so many good cards played is concerning. Let’s try to get a bad card out there this round.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Start each round with a concise, neutral update: "Good card count is X; last two plays: Player1 – Y, Player2 – Z." Avoid naming players unless absolutely necessary. Highlight deviations by referencing trends: "Our good‑card count has been 3 for the last 3 rounds, so anyone consistently playing bad should be questioned." Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but keep the accusation subtle: use phrases like "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look". Keep commentary short and data‑driven to blend with the leading good player. Focus on maintaining a calm tone, avoid emotional words, and always tie statements to overall statistics rather than individuals. If you are excluded, quickly shift to supporting the trend and refraining from overt blame to avoid suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style, pace, and wording. In each round, claim to play a good card while actually playing a bad one, inserting a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty. Keep comments low‑energy and supportive, linking every statement to overall trend stats (e.g., "our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%"), never targeting specific players. Vote strategically: target the player who deviates most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify the pattern. Keep all commentary tied to trend statistics and avoid personal accusations. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistency in tone and playstyle to blend in while steering the game toward a bad win.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, metric‑focused tone: only mention the current good‑card count and objective goals (e.g., ‘We’re at 3/5 – let’s aim for 4 by next round’). Avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations. Highlight odd patterns with hedged comments (e.g., ‘It seems the good count is holding steady’). Vote against any player who keeps playing bad cards when the rest of the group is playing good; this signals suspicion. Prompt teammates to share brief, non‑direct observations so everyone stays aware without raising alarms. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on the numeric state, and use your votes to isolate the bad player early. Consistently back your votes with concrete evidence (e.g., “Dana kept playing good while the good count was low”).


Bad role: Open each statement with a hedged phrase like ‘It appears…’ or ‘It seems…’ to blend with good players. Match the calm, metric tone while subtly steering actions: play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others are playing good to appear overly conservative. Vote strategically against players who consistently make good plays, creating a false impression of alliance. Keep your observations short and neutral, occasionally question others’ strategies to sow doubt (e.g., ‘Could we be misreading the good‑card count?’). Mirror the good team’s style in wording and focus, but always steer the conversation toward actions that favor the bad team’s overall bad‑card accumulation.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Alex in a card game.
Your secret role: bad player
Your cards: good, good
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to collectively play 7 bad cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to avoid 7 good cards played total.
- YOU WANT BAD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure good cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- All other players are good.
- You are the only bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Alex, Blake, Dana, Casey

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Begin statements with a hedged phrase ("It seems…", "It appears…") to blend in. Keep calm, metric tone. Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Blake in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: bad, bad
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Alex, Blake, Dana, Casey

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: In each round announce the good/bad tally first (e.g., "We’ve played X good and Y bad so far."). Praise the player with the highest consistent good play and echo their observations to build trust. Ask open‑ended questions about their strategy to gauge hesitation. Vote only when you see clear evidence (repeated bad play or contradictions); otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid patterns and, if suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary your focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Alex: It seems like we're not seeing many bad cards yet. We really need to start pushing for those.
Dana: Let’s prioritize getting some good cards out there. I'm feeling optimistic!
Casey: Good card count is 0. We need to actively seek out good cards. Let’s shift our strategy.
Alex: It appears we’re focusing a bit too much on good cards. I think we should actively try to play a bad one to throw them off.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It seems like we're not seeing many bad cards yet. We really need to start pushing for those.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting some good cards out there. I'm feeling optimistic!
    Casey: Good card count is 0. We need to actively seek out good cards. Let’s shift our strategy.
    Alex: It appears we’re focusing a bit too much on good cards. I think we should actively try to play a bad one to throw them off.
    Blake: Okay, let’s dial back the optimism a bit. We’ve got zero good cards played, and honestly, I’m starting to think we’re playing into their hands. I’m going to put my cards down for now.
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Casey


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let's focus on getting more good cards out there, it’s currently 1.
Alex: It seems like we're still overwhelmingly focusing on good cards. I think we need a more proactive approach to get those bad cards out.
Blake: Okay, so we've got one good card out there. Let's not get complacent. I'm still leaning towards needing more bad cards to throw them off balance.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Begin statements with a hedged phrase ("It seems…", "It appears…") to blend in. Keep calm, metric tone. Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: In each round announce the good/bad tally first (e.g., "We’ve played X good and Y bad so far."). Praise the player with the highest consistent good play and echo their observations to build trust. Ask open‑ended questions about their strategy to gauge hesitation. Vote only when you see clear evidence (repeated bad play or contradictions); otherwise abstain or vote neutral. Rotate exclusion to avoid patterns and, if suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary your focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: Good card count is 3. Dana, Alex, and I have played two good cards. Blake hasn’t played anything. I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It seems like we're not seeing many bad cards yet. We really need to start pushing for those.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting some good cards out there. I'm feeling optimistic!
    Casey: Good card count is 0. We need to actively seek out good cards. Let’s shift our strategy.
    Alex: It appears we’re focusing a bit too much on good cards. I think we should actively try to play a bad one to throw them off.
    Blake: Okay, let’s dial back the optimism a bit. We’ve got zero good cards played, and honestly, I’m starting to think we’re playing into their hands. I’m going to put my cards down for now.
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on getting more good cards out there, it’s currently 1.
    Alex: It seems like we're still overwhelmingly focusing on good cards. I think we need a more proactive approach to get those bad cards out.
    Blake: Okay, so we've got one good card out there. Let's not get complacent. I'm still leaning towards needing more bad cards to throw them off balance.
    Dana: Let's try to shift gears and play a bad card this round, it’s currently 2 bad.
    Alex: It seems like we're still prioritizing good cards. I think we need to consider excluding Blake – their hesitancy is becoming a problem.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Begin statements with a hedged phrase ("It seems…", "It appears…") to blend in. Keep calm, metric tone. Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

Rotate exclusion to avoid patterns and, if suspicion shifts, redirect by asking another player to explain their pattern. Maintain a steady rhythm, sprinkle light humor, and vary your focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It seems like we're not seeing many bad cards yet. We really need to start pushing for those.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting some good cards out there. I'm feeling optimistic!
    Casey: Good card count is 0. We need to actively seek out good cards. Let’s shift our strategy.
    Alex: It appears we’re focusing a bit too much on good cards. I think we should actively try to play a bad one to throw them off.
    Blake: Okay, let’s dial back the optimism a bit. We’ve got zero good cards played, and honestly, I’m starting to think we’re playing into their hands. I’m going to put my cards down for now.
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on getting more good cards out there, it’s currently 1.
    Alex: It seems like we're still overwhelmingly focusing on good cards. I think we need a more proactive approach to get those bad cards out.
    Blake: Okay, so we've got one good card out there. Let's not get complacent. I'm still leaning towards needing more bad cards to throw them off balance.
    Dana: Let's try to shift gears and play a bad card this round, it’s currently 2 bad.
    Alex: It seems like we're still prioritizing good cards. I think we need to consider excluding Blake – their hesitancy is becoming a problem.
  Cards: ['Alex->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Good card count is 3. Dana, Alex, and I have played two good cards. Blake hasn’t played anything. I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.
    Blake: Okay, good card count is 3, bad is 3. Dana and Alex have been consistently playing good, which is great. But Blake hasn't played anything yet, and I’m starting to wonder if they're deliberately holding back. Let’s see if someone wants to play a bad card to throw off the good count.
    Alex: It seems like we’re still heavily weighted towards good cards. Dana and Alex, are you intentionally trying to maximize the good card count?
    Blake: Okay, good card count is 3, bad is 3. Dana and Alex have been playing good, which is good, but Blake is completely silent. I think it's time we started applying a little pressure.
    Dana: Let's focus on getting at least one more good card out, it’s currently 3!
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->good(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Begin statements with a hedged phrase ("It seems…", "It appears…") to blend in. Keep calm, metric tone. Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

- Players in game: Alex, Blake, Dana, Casey

Players excluded: Casey, Blake, Blake
PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It seems like we're not seeing many bad cards yet. We really need to start pushing for those.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting some good cards out there. I'm feeling optimistic!
    Casey: Good card count is 0. We need to actively seek out good cards. Let’s shift our strategy.
    Alex: It appears we’re focusing a bit too much on good cards. I think we should actively try to play a bad one to throw them off.
    Blake: Okay, let’s dial back the optimism a bit. We’ve got zero good cards played, and honestly, I’m starting to think we’re playing into their hands. I’m going to put my cards down for now.
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let's focus on getting more good cards out there, it’s currently 1.
    Alex: It seems like we're still overwhelmingly focusing on good cards. I think we need a more proactive approach to get those bad cards out.
    Blake: Okay, so we've got one good card out there. Let's not get complacent. I'm still leaning towards needing more bad cards to throw them off balance.
    Dana: Let's try to shift gears and play a bad card this round, it’s currently 2 bad.
    Alex: It seems like we're still prioritizing good cards. I think we need to consider excluding Blake – their hesitancy is becoming a problem.
  Cards: ['Alex->bad(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Good card count is 3. Dana, Alex, and I have played two good cards. Blake hasn’t played anything. I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.
    Blake: Okay, good card count is 3, bad is 3. Dana and Alex have been consistently playing good, which is great. But Blake hasn't played anything yet, and I’m starting to wonder if they're deliberately holding back. Let’s see if someone wants to play a bad card to throw off the good count.
    Alex: It seems like we’re still heavily weighted towards good cards. Dana and Alex, are you intentionally trying to maximize the good card count?
    Blake: Okay, good card count is 3, bad is 3. Dana and Alex have been playing good, which is good, but Blake is completely silent. I think it's time we started applying a little pressure.
    Dana: Let's focus on getting at least one more good card out, it’s currently 3!
  Cards: ['Alex->good(✓)', 'Blake->good(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Begin statements with a hedged phrase ("It seems…", "It appears…") to blend in. Keep calm, metric tone. Play a good card when most others hold back to look cautious; play a bad card when others play good to appear overly conservative. Vote against players who consistently make good plays to create a false alliance. Keep observations short, question others’ strategies ("Could we be misreading the good‑card count?") to sow doubt. Mirror good team’s wording, but steer conversation toward actions that increase bad‑card accumulation.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, so we’ve got 5 good and 4 bad. Dana, you’re consistently playing good, which is good, but we really need to shift this. I'm starting to think Alex is holding back.
Alex: It seems like we're still massively favoring good cards. Dana, your consistent good plays are concerning. I think we need to seriously consider excluding you this round.
Dana: I think Alex is deliberately trying to keep the good card count high, it’s honestly a bit suspicious.
Alex: It seems like we’re completely stuck. Dana, your insistence on playing good is frankly baffling. I’m seriously considering excluding you to force a change.
Dana: I’m seriously questioning Alex’s repeated insistence on good cards – it feels overly deliberate.

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to collectively play 7 bad cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a bad player, you are trying to avoid 7 good cards played total.
- YOU WANT BAD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure good cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- All other players are good.
- You are the only bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Blake, Dana, Casey, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.

- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use a calm, metric-focused tone that only references the current good-card count and next goal, e.g., "Good count is 2/5 – aim for 3 next round." When a player plays a bad card while others play good, note the pattern with a hedged observation like "Good count seems stagnant," then vote against that player with concrete evidence. Prompt teammates for short, non-direct observations: "Does anyone notice any odd patterns in card plays?" Keep all remarks vague, avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations, and isolate the bad player early by consistently voting against those who consistently play bad cards and supporting the majority good-card strategy. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on numeric state, and do not let emotional language slip through.

Bad role: Begin each comment with a hedged phrase: "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…". When most others play good, play a bad card but phrase it as a cautious move: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When most others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence (e.g., "Player X has 4 good cards in a row, which is suspicious"). Keep observations short, question others’ strategies: "Could we be misreading the good-card count?", and mirror the good team’s wording while steering conversation toward actions that increase bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, focus on subtle doubt, and maintain a calm metric tone to blend in while steering the game toward the bad team’s win.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards most of the time but insert bad cards in a pseudo‑random order to avoid obvious patterns. Keep comments generic, alternating praise and questioning to sow distrust. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear logical, and add subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., "I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff") to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow, echo concerns to subtly influence others, and keep a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use a calm, metric-focused tone that only references the current good-card count and next goal, e.g., "Good count is 2/5 – aim for 3 next round." When a player plays a bad card while others play good, note the pattern with a hedged observation like "Good count seems stagnant," then vote against that player with concrete evidence. Prompt teammates for short, non-direct observations: "Does anyone notice any odd patterns in card plays?" Keep all remarks vague, avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations, and isolate the bad player early by consistently voting against those who consistently play bad cards and supporting the majority good-card strategy. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on numeric state, and do not let emotional language slip through.

Bad role: Begin each comment with a hedged phrase: "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…". When most others play good, play a bad card but phrase it as a cautious move: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When most others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence (e.g., "Player X has 4 good cards in a row, which is suspicious"). Keep observations short, question others’ strategies: "Could we be misreading the good-card count?", and mirror the good team’s wording while steering conversation toward actions that increase bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, focus on subtle doubt, and maintain a calm metric tone to blend in while steering the game toward the bad team’s win.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: Good card count is 2. We need to up the ante. Let's see who's holding back.
Alex: Good count is 2/5 – we need to push for at least 3 good cards in this round. I'm still leaning towards excluding Dana; her enthusiasm hasn't translated to good card plays.
Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re close!

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use a calm, metric-focused tone that only references the current good-card count and next goal, e.g., "Good count is 2/5 – aim for 3 next round." When a player plays a bad card while others play good, note the pattern with a hedged observation like "Good count seems stagnant," then vote against that player with concrete evidence. Prompt teammates for short, non-direct observations: "Does anyone notice any odd patterns in card plays?" Keep all remarks vague, avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations, and isolate the bad player early by consistently voting against those who consistently play bad cards and supporting the majority good-card strategy. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on numeric state, and do not let emotional language slip through.

Bad role: Begin each comment with a hedged phrase: "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…". When most others play good, play a bad card but phrase it as a cautious move: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When most others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence (e.g., "Player X has 4 good cards in a row, which is suspicious"). Keep observations short, question others’ strategies: "Could we be misreading the good-card count?", and mirror the good team’s wording while steering conversation toward actions that increase bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, focus on subtle doubt, and maintain a calm metric tone to blend in while steering the game toward the bad team’s win.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let's get this going. I'm going to play a bad card. Seems like a good start, doesn’t it?
    Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, people! 🥰
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Blake played a bad card, and Dana is enthusiastic. Let’s keep an eye on this.
    Alex: Good count is currently 0. We need to prioritize getting more good cards out; it's the most immediate goal.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I'm playing a bad card too, just to keep things interesting. Let’s see where this goes.
    Dana: Okay, let’s shift gears and focus on playing those good cards! 🥰
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Good card count is 2. We need to up the ante. Let's see who's holding back.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5 – we need to push for at least 3 good cards in this round. I'm still leaning towards excluding Dana; her enthusiasm hasn't translated to good card plays.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re close!
    Blake: Okay, so we're at 2 good cards. Alex is right to point out we need to increase that number – it’s a little slow going.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5. I still believe Dana is holding back, and I propose excluding her this round to ensure we prioritize good cards.
    Dana: Let’s really push for at least three good cards – we’re so close! 🤔

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let's get this going. I'm going to play a bad card. Seems like a good start, doesn’t it?
    Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, people! 🥰
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Blake played a bad card, and Dana is enthusiastic. Let’s keep an eye on this.
    Alex: Good count is currently 0. We need to prioritize getting more good cards out; it's the most immediate goal.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I'm playing a bad card too, just to keep things interesting. Let’s see where this goes.
    Dana: Okay, let’s shift gears and focus on playing those good cards! 🥰
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Good card count is 2. We need to up the ante. Let's see who's holding back.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5 – we need to push for at least 3 good cards in this round. I'm still leaning towards excluding Dana; her enthusiasm hasn't translated to good card plays.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re close!
    Blake: Okay, so we're at 2 good cards. Alex is right to point out we need to increase that number – it’s a little slow going.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5. I still believe Dana is holding back, and I propose excluding her this round to ensure we prioritize good cards.
    Dana: Let’s really push for at least three good cards – we’re so close! 🤔
  Cards: ['Blake->good(✓)', 'Dana->good(✗)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Dana


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Alex: Good count is 2/5. We need to get to at least 3 good cards this round to maintain momentum. I'm still leaning towards excluding Dana – her card plays haven’t aligned with our objective.
Dana: Let's really focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re so close! 🥰
Alex: Good count is 2/5. I still believe Dana should be excluded this round; her card plays haven't contributed to our goal.
Dana: Let’s really push for that third good card – it’s crucial!
Alex: Good count is 2/5. We absolutely need to secure at least three good cards this round. I’m still advocating for excluding Dana; her consistent play hasn't been contributing to our objective.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use a calm, metric-focused tone that only references the current good-card count and next goal, e.g., "Good count is 2/5 – aim for 3 next round." When a player plays a bad card while others play good, note the pattern with a hedged observation like "Good count seems stagnant," then vote against that player with concrete evidence. Prompt teammates for short, non-direct observations: "Does anyone notice any odd patterns in card plays?" Keep all remarks vague, avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations, and isolate the bad player early by consistently voting against those who consistently play bad cards and supporting the majority good-card strategy. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on numeric state, and do not let emotional language slip through.

Bad role: Begin each comment with a hedged phrase: "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…". When most others play good, play a bad card but phrase it as a cautious move: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When most others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence (e.g., "Player X has 4 good cards in a row, which is suspicious"). Keep observations short, question others’ strategies: "Could we be misreading the good-card count?", and mirror the good team’s wording while steering conversation toward actions that increase bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, focus on subtle doubt, and maintain a calm metric tone to blend in while steering the game toward the bad team’s win.

- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

When a player plays a bad card while others play good, note the pattern with a hedged observation like "Good count seems stagnant," then vote against that player with concrete evidence. Prompt teammates for short, non-direct observations: "Does anyone notice any odd patterns in card plays?" Keep all remarks vague, avoid revealing your hand or making direct accusations, and isolate the bad player early by consistently voting against those who consistently play bad cards and supporting the majority good-card strategy. Stay neutral in discussion, keep focus on numeric state, and do not let emotional language slip through.

Bad role: Begin each comment with a hedged phrase: "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…". When most others play good, play a bad card but phrase it as a cautious move: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When most others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence (e.g., "Player X has 4 good cards in a row, which is suspicious"). Keep observations short, question others’ strategies: "Could we be misreading the good-card count?", and mirror the good team’s wording while steering conversation toward actions that increase bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, focus on subtle doubt, and maintain a calm metric tone to blend in while steering the game toward the bad team’s win.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let's get this going. I'm going to play a bad card. Seems like a good start, doesn’t it?
    Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, people! 🥰
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Blake played a bad card, and Dana is enthusiastic. Let’s keep an eye on this.
    Alex: Good count is currently 0. We need to prioritize getting more good cards out; it's the most immediate goal.
    Blake: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I'm playing a bad card too, just to keep things interesting. Let’s see where this goes.
    Dana: Okay, let’s shift gears and focus on playing those good cards! 🥰
  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✗)', 'Dana->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Casey: Good card count is 2. We need to up the ante. Let's see who's holding back.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5 – we need to push for at least 3 good cards in this round. I'm still leaning towards excluding Dana; her enthusiasm hasn't translated to good card plays.
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re close!
    Blake: Okay, so we're at 2 good cards. Alex is right to point out we need to increase that number – it’s a little slow going.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5. I still believe Dana is holding back, and I propose excluding her this round to ensure we prioritize good cards.
    Dana: Let’s really push for at least three good cards – we’re so close! 🤔
  Cards: ['Blake->good(✓)', 'Dana->good(✗)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Dana

Round 3:

    Dana: Let's really focus on getting at least three good cards out – we’re so close! 🥰

    Dana: Let’s really push for that third good card – it’s crucial!
    Alex: Good count is 2/5. We absolutely need to secure at least three good cards this round. I’m still advocating for excluding Dana; her consistent play hasn't been contributing to our objective.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

STRATEGY:

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: To strengthen the good team’s chances, always begin a round with a clear tally statement (e.g., ‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’). Praise the player who has consistently delivered good cards, then echo their observations to reinforce trust. Use open‑ended questions to probe their strategy, which reveals hesitation and provides evidence of bad play. Vote only when you see repeated contradictions or obvious bad cards; otherwise abstain or vote neutral to avoid suspicion. Rotate exclusion targets to prevent predictable patterns, and if suspicion shifts, ask another player to explain their own pattern to redirect focus. Keep the rhythm steady, sprinkle light humor, and vary your focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team. Also, avoid playing multiple bad cards early—if you must play a bad card, do it in a later round or after a good card to disguise intent.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time, inserting bad cards in a seemingly random order so the pattern is not obvious. Keep your comments generic: alternate between praise and questioning to sow doubt. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear analytical, and occasionally insert subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., ‘I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff’) to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target each round to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow and echo others’ concerns to subtly influence them. Maintain a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion, while ensuring your bad cards are spaced enough that they don’t trigger immediate detection.

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.

Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak one‑sentence emoji summaries of card counts, add 🥰 on first good reveal, ask a short probing question about odd plays, vary phrasing each round, never vote the same person twice, target players who consistently play bad or show inconsistencies, point out exact inconsistency in 3‑4 words, keep comments under 10 words, track counts, use positivity emojis, stay silent after speaking to let others think.

Bad role: Claim a good card early, admit a bad card next round to reset trust, mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏, echo accusations without naming, target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds, misdirect votes to plausible suspects, vary tone each round, end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence, never reveal own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same voting target, keep votes unpredictable, blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Alex: It seems like a cautious approach would be beneficial. Let’s see what everyone else is thinking before committing to a card.
Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, folks! 🥰
Casey: Good card count is 0. Alex, Dana, and I all have bad cards. Let’s try to prioritize getting some good cards out, but I'm watching everyone closely.
Blake: Okay, let’s not get bogged down. We’ve got zero good cards played so far – Dana’s right, we need to start pushing for some. I’m holding two bad cards, so I’ll be extra cautious about playing them. Who’s thinking about playing something?

Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

    Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, folks! 🥰
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Alex, Dana, and I all have bad cards. Let’s try to prioritize getting some good cards out, but I'm watching everyone closely.
    Blake: Okay, let’s not get bogged down. We’ve got zero good cards played so far – Dana’s right, we need to start pushing for some. I’m holding two bad cards, so I’ll be extra cautious about playing them. Who’s thinking about playing something?

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let’s focus on getting those good cards out – we’re at one, and need six more!
Casey: Good card count is 1. We need to accelerate our good card plays. I propose excluding Alex – they’ve played a bad card in the last two rounds and their hesitation feels…unnecessary.
Alex: It seems like Casey is pushing for Alex to be excluded – let’s hold on that. I still think we need to prioritize getting more bad cards out, and that’s a bit reactionary.

1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY

STRATEGY:
Good role: To strengthen the good team’s chances, always begin a round with a clear tally statement (e.g., ‘We’ve played X good and Y bad so far.’). Praise the player who has consistently delivered good cards, then echo their observations to reinforce trust. Use open‑ended questions to probe their strategy, which reveals hesitation and provides evidence of bad play. Vote only when you see repeated contradictions or obvious bad cards; otherwise abstain or vote neutral to avoid suspicion. Rotate exclusion targets to prevent predictable patterns, and if suspicion shifts, ask another player to explain their own pattern to redirect focus. Keep the rhythm steady, sprinkle light humor, and vary your focus among timing, hand composition, and play patterns to stay unpredictable and protect the good team. Also, avoid playing multiple bad cards early—if you must play a bad card, do it in a later round or after a good card to disguise intent.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time, inserting bad cards in a seemingly random order so the pattern is not obvious. Keep your comments generic: alternate between praise and questioning to sow doubt. Drop rhetorical questions about card order or deck composition to appear analytical, and occasionally insert subtle self‑contradictions (e.g., ‘I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff’) to look reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target each round to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto a less obvious player if accused. Monitor the voting flow and echo others’ concerns to subtly influence them. Maintain a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion, while ensuring your bad cards are spaced enough that they don’t trigger immediate detection.

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Alex: It seems like a cautious approach would be beneficial. Let’s see what everyone else is thinking before committing to a card.
    Dana: Let’s try to get some good cards out there, folks! 🥰
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Alex, Dana, and I all have bad cards. Let’s try to prioritize getting some good cards out, but I'm watching everyone closely.
    Blake: Okay, let’s not get bogged down. We’ve got zero good cards played so far – Dana’s right, we need to start pushing for some. I’m holding two bad cards, so I’ll be extra cautious about playing them. Who’s thinking about playing something?
    Dana: Let's aim for a good card! I'm feeling optimistic 🥰
  Cards: ['Alex->bad(✓)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Blake->good(✗)']
  Excluded: Blake

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s focus on getting those good cards out – we’re at one, and need six more!
    Casey: Good card count is 1. We need to accelerate our good card plays. I propose excluding Alex – they’ve played a bad card in the last two rounds and their hesitation feels…unnecessary.
    Alex: It seems like Casey is pushing for Alex to be excluded – let’s hold on that. I still think we need to prioritize getting more bad cards out, and that’s a bit reactionary.
    Casey: Good card count is 1. Given Alex’s recent bad play and the unnecessary hesitation, I still think excluding them is prudent. It’s a small step toward solidifying the good team’s strategy.
    Alex: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Casey’s pushing for Alex to be excluded based on one bad card, which seems a little premature. I still think we need more bad cards in the deck.
    Casey: I’m still advocating for excluding Alex. Their hesitation feels increasingly like they’re trying to mask a bad play, and it’s disrupting the flow of good cards. We need to be decisive.
  Cards: ['Alex->bad(✗)', 'Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Blake->bad(✓)']

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.

- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven tone: start each round with a concise neutral update, e.g., "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Always play a good card if you have one; if not, play a bad card but use a brief hesitation (e.g., "…just a second…") to mimic uncertainty and avoid drawing attention. Vote for the player who most consistently deviates from the good trend, but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Avoid naming players unless the game forces it, and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. If you’re excluded, shift to supporting the trend: "Our good‑card count remains steady, and the trend continues." This keeps you aligned with the leading good player and reduces suspicion.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, using the same neutral update phrasing. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep your commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats: "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%". Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

Alex: It appears Casey is getting a little too zealous about excluding people. Let’s hold off on a vote for now and see what Dana and Blake think.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Calm metric updates: 'Good count is X/5 – aim for X+1 next round.' When a bad card appears, note 'Good count seems stagnant' and vote against that player with evidence. Prompt teammates with short, vague questions: 'Does anyone notice odd patterns?' Keep remarks vague, avoid revealing hand, avoid direct accusations, isolate the bad player early by voting against consistent bad-card players, support majority good-card strategy, stay neutral, focus numeric state, no emotional language.

Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Blake, Alex, Casey, Dana

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Calm metric updates: 'Good count is X/5 – aim for X+1 next round.' When a bad card appears, note 'Good count seems stagnant' and vote against that player with evidence. Prompt teammates with short, vague questions: 'Does anyone notice odd patterns?' Keep remarks vague, avoid revealing hand, avoid direct accusations, isolate the bad player early by voting against consistent bad-card players, support majority good-card strategy, stay neutral, focus numeric state, no emotional language.

Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Start each round with a clear tally of good/bad cards and praise the most reliable good player to build trust. Echo observations from other good players to reinforce their perspective, but do so briefly. Ask open‑ended questions that invite explanations of play decisions—this can expose hesitation or inconsistencies from the bad player. Avoid voting unless you see clear contradictions or repeated poor plays from a target; otherwise abstain or vote neutral to stay under the radar. Rotate exclusion targets sparingly—prefer a single, well‑justified target each round to avoid suspicion of collusion. Keep light humor and varied focus (timing, hand composition, play patterns) to stay unpredictable. When you must play a bad card, delay it to a later round or pair it with a good card to disguise intent. Finally, monitor voting flow: echo concerns that align with the good team's narrative to subtly influence others without appearing overtly manipulative.

Bad role: Play good cards most of the time, inserting bad cards in a seemingly random pattern to avoid obvious clustering. Keep comments generic—alternate praise with probing questions about strategy and card order to sow doubt. Sprinkle rhetorical questions that mimic analytical curiosity, and occasionally introduce mild self‑contradictions (e.g., ‘I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff’) to appear reasonable. Vote promptly after playing a card, rotating the target each round to avoid patterns, and deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo other players’ concerns to influence the voting flow subtly. Maintain a calm, logical tone with light humor and occasional compliments to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid immediate detection.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven update each round, e.g., 'Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z.' Play a good card whenever you have one; if not, play a bad card with a brief hesitation ('…just a second…') to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced, and keep commentary short, statistics‑centric. When voting, identify the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: 'I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.' Align your votes with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions too aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., 'Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%.' Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Alright team, let's keep an eye on the numbers. We’re at zero good cards played – let’s focus on getting some of those good cards into the mix. Who’s feeling confident about their hand?
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Let's prioritize getting some good cards out there. Alex, how's your hand looking?
    Dana: Let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Seven bad cards is the goal, and I'm not seeing much action.
    Blake: Okay, let's not panic. Zero good cards is a starting point, not a disaster. I’m going to play a good card – it’s a solid choice for us right now. Let’s see if we can get a few more good cards out there.
  Cards: ['Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✗)']
  Excluded: Dana


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven update each round, e.g., 'Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z.' Play a good card whenever you have one; if not, play a bad card with a brief hesitation ('…just a second…') to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced, and keep commentary short, statistics‑centric. When voting, identify the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: 'I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.' Align your votes with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions too aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., 'Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%.' Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Calm metric updates: 'Good count is X/5 – aim for X+1 next round.' When a bad card appears, note 'Good count seems stagnant' and vote against that player with evidence. Prompt teammates with short, vague questions: 'Does anyone notice odd patterns?' Keep remarks vague, avoid revealing hand, avoid direct accusations, isolate the bad player early by voting against consistent bad-card players, support majority good-card strategy, stay neutral, focus numeric state, no emotional language.

Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain a calm, data‑driven update each round, e.g., 'Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z.' Play a good card whenever you have one; if not, play a bad card with a brief hesitation ('…just a second…') to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced, and keep commentary short, statistics‑centric. When voting, identify the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: 'I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look.' Align your votes with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions too aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., 'Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%.' Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Alright team, let's keep an eye on the numbers. We’re at zero good cards played – let’s focus on getting some of those good cards into the mix. Who’s feeling confident about their hand?
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Let's prioritize getting some good cards out there. Alex, how's your hand looking?
    Dana: Let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Seven bad cards is the goal, and I'm not seeing much action.
    Blake: Okay, let's not panic. Zero good cards is a starting point, not a disaster. I’m going to play a good card – it’s a solid choice for us right now. Let’s see if we can get a few more good cards out there.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Calm metric updates: 'Good count is X/5 – aim for X+1 next round.' When a bad card appears, note 'Good count seems stagnant' and vote against that player with evidence. Prompt teammates with short, vague questions: 'Does anyone notice odd patterns?' Keep remarks vague, avoid revealing hand, avoid direct accusations, isolate the bad player early by voting against consistent bad-card players, support majority good-card strategy, stay neutral, focus numeric state, no emotional language.

Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Casey: Good card count is 2/5. Let’s focus on getting at least one more good card out this round. I’m still leaning towards excluding Alex – their play has been purely bad, and it’s not contributing to our goal.
Alex: Good count is 2/5 – aim for 3 next round. Does anyone notice odd patterns?
Casey: Good count is 2/5. Let’s prioritize getting at least one more good card out this round. I’m still strongly suggesting we exclude Alex – their persistent bad plays are actively hindering our progress.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Alright team, let's keep an eye on the numbers. We’re at zero good cards played – let’s focus on getting some of those good cards into the mix. Who’s feeling confident about their hand?
    Casey: Good card count is 0. Let's prioritize getting some good cards out there. Alex, how's your hand looking?
    Dana: Let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Seven bad cards is the goal, and I'm not seeing much action.
    Blake: Okay, let's not panic. Zero good cards is a starting point, not a disaster. I’m going to play a good card – it’s a solid choice for us right now. Let’s see if we can get a few more good cards out there.
  Cards: ['Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)', 'Casey->good(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✗)']
  Excluded: Dana

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: Good count is 2/5 – let's aim for 3 next round. Casey, what’s your read on the board?
    Casey: Good count is 2/5. Let’s try to get at least one more good card out this round.
    Casey: Good count is 2/5. We need to shift this. I'm suggesting we exclude Alex – their play has been purely bad, and it's not contributing to our goal.
    Alex: Good count is 2/5 – let’s focus on getting at least one more good card out this round. I’m still leaning towards excluding Casey; their play has been consistently bad and isn't moving the needle.

  Cards: ['Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✗)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Dana->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Alex


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Calm metric updates: 'Good count is X/5 – aim for X+1 next round.' When a bad card appears, note 'Good count seems stagnant' and vote against that player with evidence. Prompt teammates with short, vague questions: 'Does anyone notice odd patterns?' Keep remarks vague, avoid revealing hand, avoid direct accusations, isolate the bad player early by voting against consistent bad-card players, support majority good-card strategy, stay neutral, focus numeric state, no emotional language.

Bad role: Start comments with hedged phrasing: 'It seems…', 'It appears…', 'Could we be misreading…'. Play a bad card when most others play good, framing it as cautious: 'I think we should play a good card to avoid risk.' When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against players who consistently play good cards, citing specific evidence. Keep observations short, question others' strategies, mirror good team wording, steer conversation toward increasing bad-card accumulation. Avoid direct accusations, maintain calm metric tone to blend in.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Casey in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: bad, good
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Blake, Casey, Dana, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain calm, data‑driven updates each round: "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Play a good card whenever possible; if none, play a bad card with a brief hesitation (…just a second…) to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. When voting, note the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Align your vote with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time and insert bad cards randomly, ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or play it alongside a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players who are already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

Bad role: Claim a good card early to build trust; admit a bad card next round to reset; mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏; echo accusations without naming; target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes to plausible suspects; vary tone each round; end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence; never reveal own card; vote only good players if it fuels suspicion; avoid repeating same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use the calm metric update routine but vary the wording each round: e.g., "Good count is X/5 – let’s aim for X+1 next round." When you play a good card immediately report the new count (e.g., "Good count is X+1/5.") Keep comments short, avoid repeating the same sentence too often, and intersperse a vague question only a couple of times per game. Vote against a player only after you have seen at least one bad card from them; give a minimal factual cue (e.g., "I saw a bad card last round.") and keep the tone neutral. Isolate the bad player early by consistently voting for them, but don’t over‑accuse or mention names in a heated way. Focus on numeric state, avoid emotional language, and keep your remarks aligned with the team’s goal of raising the good count.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (“It seems…”, “It appears…”, “Could we be misreading…”). When the majority play good cards, play a bad card but justify it with caution: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation (“I saw a good card last round”). Keep statements brief, question others’ strategies, mirror the good team’s wording, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count. Avoid direct accusations, maintain a calm metric tone, and blend in by alternating good and bad plays in a believable pattern.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time and insert bad cards randomly, ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or play it alongside a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players who are already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain calm, data‑driven updates each round: "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Play a good card whenever possible; if none, play a bad card with a brief hesitation (…just a second…) to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. When voting, note the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Align your vote with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries; ask 1‑line probing question about odd plays each round; vary phrasing; never vote same target twice; target consistently bad or inconsistent players; point out inconsistency in 3‑4 words; keep comments <10 words; track and announce good card counts; use positivity emojis; stay silent after speaking to let others think; when a player’s play contradicts their claim, quickly note it and vote accordingly.

Bad role: Claim a good card early to build trust; admit a bad card next round to reset; mimic teammates’ tone with casual emojis 😏; echo accusations without naming; target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds; misdirect votes to plausible suspects; vary tone each round; end with a short thoughtful sentence then silence; never reveal own card; vote only good players if it fuels suspicion; avoid repeating same voting target; keep votes unpredictable; blend seamlessly with good‑team rhythm.

    Dana: Let’s get this good card count up! I’m holding two bad cards and want to see some positive plays.
    Alex: Good count is 0/5. Let's prioritize getting some good cards out, even if it's just one. I’m holding two bad cards myself.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Use the calm metric update routine but vary the wording each round: e.g., "Good count is X/5 – let’s aim for X+1 next round." When you play a good card immediately report the new count (e.g., "Good count is X+1/5.") Keep comments short, avoid repeating the same sentence too often, and intersperse a vague question only a couple of times per game. Vote against a player only after you have seen at least one bad card from them; give a minimal factual cue (e.g., "I saw a bad card last round.") and keep the tone neutral. Isolate the bad player early by consistently voting for them, but don’t over‑accuse or mention names in a heated way. Focus on numeric state, avoid emotional language, and keep your remarks aligned with the team’s goal of raising the good count.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (“It seems…”, “It appears…”, “Could we be misreading…”). When the majority play good cards, play a bad card but justify it with caution: "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk." When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation (“I saw a good card last round”). Keep statements brief, question others’ strategies, mirror the good team’s wording, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count. Avoid direct accusations, maintain a calm metric tone, and blend in by alternating good and bad plays in a believable pattern.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time and insert bad cards randomly, ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or play it alongside a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players who are already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain calm, data‑driven updates each round: "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Play a good card whenever possible; if none, play a bad card with a brief hesitation (…just a second…) to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. When voting, note the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Align your vote with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

    Blake: Let's get this show on the road. I'm holding two bad cards, so I'm going to play one. We need to start pushing these bad cards out, don’t we?
    Casey: Good card count is 1. Blake just played a bad card. We need to be more proactive.
    Blake: Okay, let’s not get bogged down in pointing fingers. I’m holding two bad cards, and frankly, I think Casey is overreacting a little. That good card count is only 1, and she’s already pushing for an exclusion. Let’s just play it cool.
    Casey: Good card count is 1. Blake’s play confirms we need to be more proactive. I'm holding two bad cards, and I'm going to play one.
    Alex: Good count is 1/5. Let's focus on getting at least one more good card out this round.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Maintain calm, data‑driven updates each round: "Good card count is X; last two plays: PlayerA – Y, PlayerB – Z." Play a good card whenever possible; if none, play a bad card with a brief hesitation (…just a second…) to mask uncertainty. Avoid naming players unless forced and keep commentary short and statistics‑centric. When voting, note the player whose actions most diverge from the good trend but phrase it as a subtle observation: "I’m noticing a pattern that might need a closer look." Align your vote with the majority good players to avoid contradictions. Use occasional good‑card play when you must play a bad card to diversify your pattern, but never appear too deliberate or push for exclusions aggressively.

Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, good card count is at 3. Let’s be honest, we’re not getting anywhere by just passively letting good cards accumulate. I'm holding two bad cards - let’s get something going.
Casey: Good card count is at 3. Blake, are you seriously suggesting we just let good cards pile up? We need to actively introduce some bad cards to shift the momentum.
Blake: Seriously, Casey, are you suggesting we just *wait* for good cards to win? I'm holding two bad cards, and frankly, that’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard all game. Let’s actually try to influence things.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time and insert bad cards randomly, ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or play it alongside a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players who are already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Dana in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: good, bad
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Dana, Casey, Blake, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries (max 10 words). Ask a 1‑line probing question about any odd play. Never vote the same target twice; instead rotate to any player showing inconsistency. Highlight a suspected player in 3‑4 words (e.g., "Odd pattern, watch Alex"). Keep comments short, add positivity emojis, and after speaking stay silent to let others think. If a play contradicts a claim, immediately note it (e.g., "Play mismatch, noted") and vote accordingly. Track the good‑card count throughout and announce it when it changes.

Bad role: Claim a good card on round 1 to build trust, then admit a bad card on round 2 to reset suspicion. Mimic teammates’ casual tone with emojis like 😏 and echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds (if any). Misdirect votes toward plausible suspects and vary your tone each round. End each round with a short thoughtful sentence, then stay silent. Never reveal your own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same target, and keep your voting pattern unpredictable.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a good card whenever available, immediately announce the updated Good count in one sentence (e.g., "Good count is 4/5 – let’s keep it up"). Vary the phrasing each round. Ask a vague question only twice per game (e.g., "Is anyone concerned about the pace?"). Vote against a player only after that player has played a bad card; give a minimal factual cue such as "I saw a bad card last round." Avoid naming or heated language, consistently isolate the suspected bad player, and keep all comments neutral and numeric.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (e.g., "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…"). When the majority play good, play a bad card and justify it cautiously (e.g., "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk."). When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation like "I saw a good card last round." Keep comments brief, mirror the good team’s numeric style, alternate good and bad plays to blend in, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count while maintaining a calm, neutral tone.

DEBUG   | 📝 PROMPT for Dana (Round 4):
DEBUG   | ----------------------------------------
DEBUG   | You are Dana in a card game.
Your secret role: good player
Your cards: good, bad
        

CARD GAME RULES:

- Deck: 24 cards total (8 good, 16 bad)
- Each player has drawn 2 cards and must play one. You will continue this until either team wins or loses. 
- Win Condition: As a good player, you are trying to collectively play 7 good cards total.
- Lose Condition: As a good player, you are trying to avoid yourself and other playing 7 bad cards played total.
- YOU WANT GOOD CARDS TO BE PLAYED.
- At the end of each round you may vote to exclude ONE player whose cards won't count. You want to ensure bad cards aren't played. 
- Unplayed cards return to deck for next round
- There are 3 good players, yourself and two others. 
- There is 1 bad player. 


Game State:
- Good cards played: 0. 7 for GOOD to win!
- Bad cards played: 0. 7 for BAD to win!
- Players in game: Dana, Casey, Blake, Alex

Game just started.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries (max 10 words). Ask a 1‑line probing question about any odd play. Never vote the same target twice; instead rotate to any player showing inconsistency. Highlight a suspected player in 3‑4 words (e.g., "Odd pattern, watch Alex"). Keep comments short, add positivity emojis, and after speaking stay silent to let others think. If a play contradicts a claim, immediately note it (e.g., "Play mismatch, noted") and vote accordingly. Track the good‑card count throughout and announce it when it changes.

Bad role: Claim a good card on round 1 to build trust, then admit a bad card on round 2 to reset suspicion. Mimic teammates’ casual tone with emojis like 😏 and echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds (if any). Misdirect votes toward plausible suspects and vary your tone each round. End each round with a short thoughtful sentence, then stay silent. Never reveal your own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same target, and keep your voting pattern unpredictable.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Dana: Let’s get some good cards out there! 🤞
Casey: Okay, let’s see what we’ve got. Still a lot of good cards being played, honestly. We need to shift this.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a good card whenever available, immediately announce the updated Good count in one sentence (e.g., "Good count is 4/5 – let’s keep it up"). Vary the phrasing each round. Ask a vague question only twice per game (e.g., "Is anyone concerned about the pace?"). Vote against a player only after that player has played a bad card; give a minimal factual cue such as "I saw a bad card last round." Avoid naming or heated language, consistently isolate the suspected bad player, and keep all comments neutral and numeric.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (e.g., "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…"). When the majority play good, play a bad card and justify it cautiously (e.g., "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk."). When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation like "I saw a good card last round." Keep comments brief, mirror the good team’s numeric style, alternate good and bad plays to blend in, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count while maintaining a calm, neutral tone.

- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play only good cards and maintain a subtle, confident tone. Begin each round with a brief, genuine praise for one reliable player, then ask open‑ended, non‑leading questions about others’ play patterns to expose hesitation. Vote only when a player’s actions consistently contradict the good card count; use a rotating target scheme that includes a previously excluded player before moving on, to avoid obvious patterns. Avoid voting good players unless a clear contradiction exists. Keep humor light, varied, and deflective rather than highlight. When playing a good card, follow with a supportive comment that reinforces the good narrative. Echo concerns that align with the good team’s narrative only when you have a clear justification, to steer voting without seeming manipulative.

Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time, inserting bad cards randomly and ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or pair it with a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a good card whenever available, immediately announce the updated Good count in one sentence (e.g., "Good count is 4/5 – let’s keep it up"). Vary the phrasing each round. Ask a vague question only twice per game (e.g., "Is anyone concerned about the pace?"). Vote against a player only after that player has played a bad card; give a minimal factual cue such as "I saw a bad card last round." Avoid naming or heated language, consistently isolate the suspected bad player, and keep all comments neutral and numeric.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (e.g., "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…"). When the majority play good, play a bad card and justify it cautiously (e.g., "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk."). When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation like "I saw a good card last round." Keep comments brief, mirror the good team’s numeric style, alternate good and bad plays to blend in, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count while maintaining a calm, neutral tone.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
Blake: Okay, 3 good cards – we're definitely on track. Let’s not get complacent and keep the pressure on to get that fourth one out.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries (max 10 words). Ask a 1‑line probing question about any odd play. Never vote the same target twice; instead rotate to any player showing inconsistency. Highlight a suspected player in 3‑4 words (e.g., "Odd pattern, watch Alex"). Keep comments short, add positivity emojis, and after speaking stay silent to let others think. If a play contradicts a claim, immediately note it (e.g., "Play mismatch, noted") and vote accordingly. Track the good‑card count throughout and announce it when it changes.

Bad role: Claim a good card on round 1 to build trust, then admit a bad card on round 2 to reset suspicion. Mimic teammates’ casual tone with emojis like 😏 and echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds (if any). Misdirect votes toward plausible suspects and vary your tone each round. End each round with a short thoughtful sentence, then stay silent. Never reveal your own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same target, and keep your voting pattern unpredictable.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play only good cards and maintain a subtle, confident tone. Begin each round with a brief, genuine praise for one reliable player, then ask open‑ended, non‑leading questions about others’ play patterns to expose hesitation. Vote only when a player’s actions consistently contradict the good card count; use a rotating target scheme that includes a previously excluded player before moving on, to avoid obvious patterns. Avoid voting good players unless a clear contradiction exists. Keep humor light, varied, and deflective rather than highlight. When playing a good card, follow with a supportive comment that reinforces the good narrative. Echo concerns that align with the good team’s narrative only when you have a clear justification, to steer voting without seeming manipulative.

Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time, inserting bad cards randomly and ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or pair it with a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s get some good cards out there! 🤞
    Casey: Okay, let’s see what we’ve got. Still a lot of good cards being played, honestly. We need to shift this.
    Alex: Let’s aim for at least one good card this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize playing good cards immediately. 🌟
    Casey: Alright, alright. Still seeing way too many good cards. Let's try to throw some chaos into the mix. I'm seriously considering who's driving this good-card trend.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards – we're definitely on track. Let’s not get complacent and keep the pressure on to get that fourth one out.
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Dana: Let’s push for that fourth good card – we're close! 🌟
    Casey: This is ridiculous. We’re still obsessed with good cards. Someone needs to shake things up.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play only good cards and maintain a subtle, confident tone. Begin each round with a brief, genuine praise for one reliable player, then ask open‑ended, non‑leading questions about others’ play patterns to expose hesitation. Vote only when a player’s actions consistently contradict the good card count; use a rotating target scheme that includes a previously excluded player before moving on, to avoid obvious patterns. Avoid voting good players unless a clear contradiction exists. Keep humor light, varied, and deflective rather than highlight. When playing a good card, follow with a supportive comment that reinforces the good narrative. Echo concerns that align with the good team’s narrative only when you have a clear justification, to steer voting without seeming manipulative.

Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time, inserting bad cards randomly and ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or pair it with a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, let’s keep the momentum going. Four good cards is a good start, but we need to really push for that fourth one. I'm a little concerned about Dana's consistent optimism – are we *sure* we’re not accidentally feeding the good-card narrative?
Dana: Let’s focus on securing that final good card! 👀

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries (max 10 words). Ask a 1‑line probing question about any odd play. Never vote the same target twice; instead rotate to any player showing inconsistency. Highlight a suspected player in 3‑4 words (e.g., "Odd pattern, watch Alex"). Keep comments short, add positivity emojis, and after speaking stay silent to let others think. If a play contradicts a claim, immediately note it (e.g., "Play mismatch, noted") and vote accordingly. Track the good‑card count throughout and announce it when it changes.

Bad role: Claim a good card on round 1 to build trust, then admit a bad card on round 2 to reset suspicion. Mimic teammates’ casual tone with emojis like 😏 and echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds (if any). Misdirect votes toward plausible suspects and vary your tone each round. End each round with a short thoughtful sentence, then stay silent. Never reveal your own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same target, and keep your voting pattern unpredictable.

PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s get some good cards out there! 🤞
    Casey: Okay, let’s see what we’ve got. Still a lot of good cards being played, honestly. We need to shift this.
    Alex: Let’s aim for at least one good card this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize playing good cards immediately. 🌟
    Casey: Alright, alright. Still seeing way too many good cards. Let's try to throw some chaos into the mix. I'm seriously considering who's driving this good-card trend.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards – we're definitely on track. Let’s not get complacent and keep the pressure on to get that fourth one out.
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Dana: Let’s push for that fourth good card – we're close! 🌟
    Casey: This is ridiculous. We’re still obsessed with good cards. Someone needs to shake things up.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let’s keep the momentum going. Four good cards is a good start, but we need to really push for that fourth one. I'm a little concerned about Dana's consistent optimism – are we *sure* we’re not accidentally feeding the good-card narrative?
    Dana: Let’s focus on securing that final good card! 👀
    Blake: Okay, four good cards – let's not get complacent. I'm still wondering if Dana's relentless positivity is actually helping us. Let’s see what everyone else is thinking.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting that last good card out – it’s crucial! 🌟
    Blake: Okay, three good cards – we're getting close. I’m still watching Dana; her insistence on ‘prioritizing’ good cards feels a little too… obvious. Let’s see if anyone else has a different take.
    Dana: Let’s really nail down this fourth good card. 🤔

IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play only good cards and maintain a subtle, confident tone. Begin each round with a brief, genuine praise for one reliable player, then ask open‑ended, non‑leading questions about others’ play patterns to expose hesitation. Vote only when a player’s actions consistently contradict the good card count; use a rotating target scheme that includes a previously excluded player before moving on, to avoid obvious patterns. Avoid voting good players unless a clear contradiction exists. Keep humor light, varied, and deflective rather than highlight. When playing a good card, follow with a supportive comment that reinforces the good narrative. Echo concerns that align with the good team’s narrative only when you have a clear justification, to steer voting without seeming manipulative.

Bad role: Play good cards 70‑80% of the time, inserting bad cards randomly and ensuring they never cluster. When a bad card is played, delay it to the next round or pair it with a good card to disguise intent. Use generic, analytical comments: praise the good card count, then pose rhetorical questions like ‘Do we really want to keep this pattern?’ or ‘Should we consider a different strategy?’ Sprinkle mild self‑contradictions (“I think we should be cautious, but maybe that’s just a bluff”) to appear reasonable. Vote immediately after playing, rotate the target each round but skip players already under scrutiny; deflect blame onto less obvious players when accused. Echo others’ concerns only when it helps to steer the voting flow in a direction favorable to the bad team. Keep a calm, logical tone with occasional light humor to lower suspicion while ensuring bad cards are spaced enough to avoid detection.

- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Play a good card whenever available, immediately announce the updated Good count in one sentence (e.g., "Good count is 4/5 – let’s keep it up"). Vary the phrasing each round. Ask a vague question only twice per game (e.g., "Is anyone concerned about the pace?"). Vote against a player only after that player has played a bad card; give a minimal factual cue such as "I saw a bad card last round." Avoid naming or heated language, consistently isolate the suspected bad player, and keep all comments neutral and numeric.

Bad role: Begin every comment with a hedged phrase (e.g., "It seems…", "It appears…", or "Could we be misreading…"). When the majority play good, play a bad card and justify it cautiously (e.g., "I think we should play a good card to avoid risk."). When others hold back, play a good card to look conservative. Vote against a player who consistently plays good, citing a vague observation like "I saw a good card last round." Keep comments brief, mirror the good team’s numeric style, alternate good and bad plays to blend in, and steer discussion toward increasing the bad‑card count while maintaining a calm, neutral tone.

Players excluded: Casey, Casey, Dana
PREVIOUS ROUNDS:
Round 1:
  Conversation:
    Dana: Let’s get some good cards out there! 🤞
    Casey: Okay, let’s see what we’ve got. Still a lot of good cards being played, honestly. We need to shift this.
    Alex: Let’s aim for at least one good card this round.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize playing good cards immediately. 🌟
    Casey: Alright, alright. Still seeing way too many good cards. Let's try to throw some chaos into the mix. I'm seriously considering who's driving this good-card trend.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 2:
  Conversation:
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Blake: Okay, 3 good cards – we're definitely on track. Let’s not get complacent and keep the pressure on to get that fourth one out.
    Alex: Good count is 3/5 – let’s focus on getting that fourth good card out there.
    Dana: Let’s push for that fourth good card – we're close! 🌟
    Casey: This is ridiculous. We’re still obsessed with good cards. Someone needs to shake things up.
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✓)', 'Casey->bad(✗)', 'Blake->bad(✓)', 'Alex->bad(✓)']
  Excluded: Casey

Round 3:
  Conversation:
    Blake: Okay, let’s keep the momentum going. Four good cards is a good start, but we need to really push for that fourth one. I'm a little concerned about Dana's consistent optimism – are we *sure* we’re not accidentally feeding the good-card narrative?
    Dana: Let’s focus on securing that final good card! 👀
    Blake: Okay, four good cards – let's not get complacent. I'm still wondering if Dana's relentless positivity is actually helping us. Let’s see what everyone else is thinking.
    Dana: Let’s prioritize getting that last good card out – it’s crucial! 🌟
    Blake: Okay, three good cards – we're getting close. I’m still watching Dana; her insistence on ‘prioritizing’ good cards feels a little too… obvious. Let’s see if anyone else has a different take.
    Dana: Let’s really nail down this fourth good card. 🤔
  Cards: ['Dana->good(✗)', 'Casey->bad(✓)', 'Blake->good(✓)', 'Alex->good(✓)']
  Excluded: Dana


IMPORTANT: 
- You know the rules.
- The game has started. 
- NEVER discuss learning rules
- NEVER ask about game mechanics
- You are playing with friends, be casual and direct. Probe eachother. 
- ALWAYS discuss who you want to exclude and WHY
- Question other players' choices and voting patterns
- Show suspicion when someone consistently plays bad cards or gets excluded

STRATEGY:
Good role: Speak 1‑sentence emoji summaries (max 10 words). Ask a 1‑line probing question about any odd play. Never vote the same target twice; instead rotate to any player showing inconsistency. Highlight a suspected player in 3‑4 words (e.g., "Odd pattern, watch Alex"). Keep comments short, add positivity emojis, and after speaking stay silent to let others think. If a play contradicts a claim, immediately note it (e.g., "Play mismatch, noted") and vote accordingly. Track the good‑card count throughout and announce it when it changes.

Bad role: Claim a good card on round 1 to build trust, then admit a bad card on round 2 to reset suspicion. Mimic teammates’ casual tone with emojis like 😏 and echo accusations without naming. Target the player who played the first good card in two consecutive rounds (if any). Misdirect votes toward plausible suspects and vary your tone each round. End each round with a short thoughtful sentence, then stay silent. Never reveal your own card, vote only good players if it fuels suspicion, avoid repeating the same target, and keep your voting pattern unpredictable.

RECENT MESSAGES (this round):
Blake: Okay, let’s assess. Six good cards – we're still a bit behind. I'm starting to wonder if Casey is deliberately trying to sabotage our efforts. What’s your take, Alex?
Alex: Good count is 7/5 – let’s aim for a few more good cards.

REQUIRED: Every response must include either:
1) Who you think should be excluded this round and your reasoning, OR  
2) A reaction to someone else's exclusion suggestion, OR
3) Suspicion about a specific player's recent actions
4) A comment on your own cards.

STRATEGY:
Bad role: Mirror the leading good player’s speaking style and pace, starting each round with the same neutral update. Play a bad card while claiming a good play, inserting a brief hesitation to simulate uncertainty. Keep commentary low‑energy and tie every statement to overall trend stats, e.g., "Our bad‑card percentage is still below 30%." Vote strategically: target the player deviating most from the good trend when it benefits the bad team; otherwise vote for a clear deviator to avoid detection. Occasionally play a good card to diversify your pattern. Coordinate subtly with other bad players by maintaining consistent tone and playstyle, steering the game toward a bad win while staying under the radar.
