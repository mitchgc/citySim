============================================================

CONVERSATION:
----------------------------------------
Alex: "Good count is 3/5 â€“ letâ€™s focus on getting that fourth good card out there."
Blake: "Okay, 3 good cards â€“ we're definitely on track. Letâ€™s not get complacent and keep the pressure on to get that fourth one out."
Alex: "Good count is 3/5 â€“ letâ€™s focus on getting that fourth good card out there."
Dana: "Letâ€™s push for that fourth good card â€“ we're close! ðŸŒŸ"

ROUND 3
============================================================

CONVERSATION:
----------------------------------------
Blake: "Okay, letâ€™s keep the momentum going. Four good cards is a good start, but we need to really push for that fourth one. I'm a little concerned about Dana's consistent optimism â€“ are we *sure* weâ€™re not accidentally feeding the good-card narrative?"
Dana: "Letâ€™s focus on securing that final good card! ðŸ‘€"
Blake: "Okay, four good cards â€“ let's not get complacent. I'm still wondering if Dana's relentless positivity is actually helping us. Letâ€™s see what everyone else is thinking."
Dana: "Letâ€™s prioritize getting that last good card out â€“ itâ€™s crucial! ðŸŒŸ"
Blake: "Okay, three good cards â€“ we're getting close. Iâ€™m still watching Dana; her insistence on â€˜prioritizingâ€™ good cards feels a little tooâ€¦ obvious. Letâ€™s see if anyone else has a different take."
Dana: "Letâ€™s really nail down this fourth good card. ðŸ¤”"

ROUND 4
============================================================

CONVERSATION:
----------------------------------------
Blake: "Okay, letâ€™s assess. Six good cards â€“ we're still a bit behind. I'm starting to wonder if Casey is deliberately trying to sabotage our efforts. Whatâ€™s your take, Alex?"
Alex: "Good count is 7/5 â€“ letâ€™s aim for a few more good cards."
Dana: "Seven good cards! Let's keep the momentum going. ðŸ¤”"
Casey: "Seriously, seven good cards? Alex, youâ€™re fueling this thing. Someone needs to inject some chaos. I'm voting to exclude Dana â€“ her constant 'momentum' talk is practically screaming 'good card!'"
